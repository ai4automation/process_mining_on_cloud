It was not that I was using a shortcut for creating macro. The question asks me to manually go into the create macros window, name the macro, assign the macro a shortcut key, and then exit the macro window and type in 800-555-5555, then stop the macro. As per instructions,I was required to provide a shortcut for the macro, specifically ALT+B; now I literally pressed the ""ALT"" and ""B"" buttons together on the key board and whenever I went to hit the assign button it asked me whether or not I wanted to move on or restart. Frankly it does not matter a whole lot if I am able to get the point back, but that question was not working, at least for me. Even going back and looking at the tutorial, it has you do the same thing of assigning a shortcut to a macro.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> On Sunday, August 23, 2015 4:42 PM, IBM - Customer Support &lt;proveitsupport@us.ibm.com&gt; wrote:<br/><br/><br/>This ticket has been closed, thank you for your time!Dear Logan Rich,<br/><br/>Thank you for contacting the IBM Global Support Center.
